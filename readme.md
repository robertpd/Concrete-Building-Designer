This project is incomplete and not in active development. I am currently
re-developing and hosting this project offline.

This tool designs and generates a bill of quantities for a basic
reinforced concrete structure and provides an assessmennt of the
[Embodied Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_energy) contained in the materials used.

Design configuration includes the ability to specify the number of
stories, number of bays, bay dimmensions and column cross section.

This tool was developed as part of a final year project for my B.E.
Civil Engineering degree and is concerned with highlighting the energy
required during construction.
